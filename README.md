**Daily rules:**  
- Max 2h (usually 1h)

- No weekend heroics — sustainable or nothing

**Final product: "AIVoice"**  
An autonomous AI agent that manages an AI engineer's entire professional social media presence:

- Daily curates the top 10 real trends (arXiv, X, HN, Reddit, Hugging Face)
- Suggests 3–5 accounts to follow with reasoning
- Generates high-engagement threads/posts in your voice
- Analyzes past post performance and recommends improvements
- Can auto-post (with approval) to X/LinkedIn via API

Built 100% open-source: Llama-3.1-8B (fine-tuned on AI engineering writing styles) + RAG over latest papers/posts + LangChain agents + vLLM serving + FastAPI

Grok is my 24/7 mentor.

Watch me transform from "guy who reads about AI" → "guy who ships production LLM systems".

If I can do it, anyone can.
